# Currency-Converter-
JS Web Developer Homework

Exercise 1:
Build a currency exchange JavaScript web application. Client side - JavaScript ES6 or ES5, 
server side - node.js. Supported browsers IE9+, latest Chrome, FF. 
Exchange rates should be retrieved from the xml feed at http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-hist-90d.xml 
and store currency rates in an in-memory data-structure. Build a web interface that provides

a) Exchange facility between two arbitrary currencies using the latest rate
b) Make sure when using the exchange facility there is no page reload and currency is computed asynchronous AJAX calls
c) Historical data presentation for any selected currency using Rickshaw 
or with any other client side charting component with similar functionalities
(http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/)
d) Make the historical currency representation interactive like in this example
(http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/examples/lines.html).
It’s possible that you might have some errors/problems with Rickshaw. In this case it’s also a part of the test to solve these problems.
